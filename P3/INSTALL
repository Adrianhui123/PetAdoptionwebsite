# 2. How to configure various servers (e.g., Nginx, Apache, etc)

Environment: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

Ensure that you have python3, pip, and npm installed on your machine

git clone the group_3473 repository

All of the python packages are listed below

As well as in the requirements.txt file, run pip install -r requirements.txt to install all the packages

To configure the server, you need to install nginx and gunicorn

sudo apt-get install nginx

sudo apt-get install gunicorn

To run the backend, you need to run the following commands in the backend directory

python3 manage.py makemigrations
sudo python3 manage.py migrate --run-syncdb
sudo gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:80 --daemon

To run the frontend, you need to run the following commands in the frontend directory
npm install
npm run build

Create a config file in /etc/nginx/sites-available/ with the following content
server {
listen 443;
server_name mysite.com www.mysite.com;
root /home/ubuntu/group_3473/P3/frontend/build;
location / {
try_files $uri /index.html;
  }
}

Create a symbolic link in /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/ to the config file in /etc/nginx/sites-available/

run sudo nginx -t to check if the config file is correct

run sudo systemctl restart nginx to restart nginx

sudo nginx -s reload
